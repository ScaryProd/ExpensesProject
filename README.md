# ExpensesProject

This project's goal is to make an expense tracker for myself, since they might be getting out of control

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

# TO DO

This is a project that I plan to customize and add personal features, so this list might be updated from time to time

## Expense adder screen

### Category 

Restaurants, groceries, utilities, clothes, games, pets

### Currency 

MXN, USD. The idea is to have it all in MXN but sometimes input some expenses in USD.
Could add a feature to have a live conversion rate. 
Ofc, as it fluctuates, it'll be important to save both pre and after conversion.

### Subscriptions

Spotify, games, memberships

### Credit card limit / ideal spending

Say your card only lets you spend $400 (thank you Hey), have a goal to keep it at 20%

### Persistent debt repayment

If you owe a certain amount, you can also track how much has gone into it.

### Savings

Savings accounts, how much goes into savings, adding a backlog of savings

## List of expenses

### Catalogue-ability

Filtered, ordered, sorted, etc.

## Expense type creation

If I ever get into a new type of expense, maybe trading card collecting (god I hope not) it can be dynamically added to the type database.
