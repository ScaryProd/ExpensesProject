# ExpensesProject

This project's goal is to make an expense tracker for myself, since they might be getting out of control

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.

## Further help

To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular CLI Overview and Command Reference](https://angular.io/cli) page.


# TO DO

## Expense adder screen

### Type 

Restaurants, groceries, utilities, clothes, games

### Currency 

MXN, USD. The idea is to have it all in MXN but sometimes input some expenses in USD.
Could add a feature to have a live conversion rate. 
Ofc, as it fluctuates, it'll be important to save both pre and after conversion.

## Add a list of expenses

### They can be catalogued

Filtered, ordered, sorted, etc.

## Expense type creation screen

If I ever get into a new type of expense, maybe trading card collecting (god I hope not) it can be dynamically added to the type database.
